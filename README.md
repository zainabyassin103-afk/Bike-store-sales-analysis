### Project overview
In this project, I analyzed a bike store’s sales data to extract key business insights and visualize performance metrics. The analysis included monthly sales trends, profit by country, top product lines, customer demographics, and yearly sales patterns, helping the business make data-driven decisions and identify growth opportunities.

### Data sources
sales data: the primary data used for this project is "sales_data" csv file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the store. 
### Tools
- Excel - data cleaning / data analysis 
- powerBI - data visualization and reporting
- ### Data cleaning/preparation
- In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
  
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.
4. remove duplicates.
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the region with the highest profit?
- Which product line is top seller?
- What are the peak sales periods?
  ### Results/Findings
  The analysis results are summarized as follows:
  
1. Monthly sales peaked in December and June, while July recorded the lowest sales, indicating the need for inventory planning during high-demand months and targeted marketing during low-performing periods.
2. The USA generated the highest profit, followed by Australia, whereas France had the lowest, suggesting strong expansion and investment opportunities in the USA.
3. Bikes are the top-performing product line, contributing over 72% of total revenue, making them the key focus for promotion, restocking, and strategic investment.
### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Increase inventory for December and June, and run marketing campaigns in July.
- Invest more in the USA market and improve strategies in low-profit regions like France.
- Prioritize and promote the Bikes category as the main revenue driver.
